# COVID19-Data-Analysis
On this project , I tried to conduct a brief analysis in historical COVID19 data and find existing correlations between them and specific life factors like GDP per capita, healty life expectancy etc. 

I have to mention that this project is primarly based on a guided project offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python) and it was a really great chance to dive into the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
